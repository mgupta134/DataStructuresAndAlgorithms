#LinkedList

Linked list is a data structure which saves data in a sequential manner. Data in linked list is linked through pointers with each other.

There are two types of Linked list.
 
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List 

##Singly linked list
In this type of linked list data is only linked with a single connection from right to left only. 

Head Node -> [1 | next ] -> [2 | next ] -> [3 | next ] -> [4 | next ] -> Null

##Doubly linked list
In doubly linked list, element has a pointer to next element as well as previous element. 

Head Node/Null <-> [ previous | 1 | next ] -> [ previous | 2 | next ] -> [ previous | 3 | next ] -> [ previous | 4 | next ] -> Null
